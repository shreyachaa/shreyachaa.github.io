I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at University of California, Berkeley. I work at the intersection of firms and labor markets in developing countries, with a focus on South Asia. Prior to starting grad school, I worked as a research assistant with Professors Tavneet Suri, Natalia Rigol and Benjamin Roth.
