I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the [Agricultural and Resource Economics](https://are.berkeley.edu) department at University of California, Berkeley. I work at the intersection of firms and labor markets in developing countries, with a focus on South Asia. Prior to starting grad school, I worked as a research assistant with Professors Tavneet Suri, Natalia Rigol and Benjamin Roth. I completed my undergraduate in Economics from Delhi University, India and Master's in Development Economics from the Yale IDE program.
